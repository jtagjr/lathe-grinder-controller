This project is for use on my K.O. Lee surface grinder. It receives input from the user via a stop button, start button and 2 rotary encoder switches. It displays output on a four character LED display. These buttons can start, stop, and change the speed of a servo motor by sending messages over the Modbus to a servo motor controller. The user can set the speed (RPMs) of the motor via the rotary encoder switches. The speed is displayed on the LED display.
